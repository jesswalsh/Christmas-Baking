	Vanilla Cake
</h2>
<h3>
	Ingredients
</h3>
<ul>
	<li>2 cups sugar</li>
	<li>3 1/4 cups flour</li>
	<li>2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
	<li>3/4 cup unsalted butter, soft</li>
	<li>1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature</li>
	<li>1 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
	<li>4 eggs</li>
</ul>
<h3>
	Methods
</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Preheat the oven to 350°F and lightly grease a 9″ x 13″ pan.</li>
	<li>In a large mixing bowl, combine sugar, flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
	<li>Add butter to the dry ingredients and mix at low speed until the mixture looks sandy.</li>
	<li>In a small bowl or measuring cup, combine milk and vanilla. Add to sand-like mixture and mix for a couple of minutes at low speed.</li>
	<li>Turn mixer to low speed and add 1 egg while it’s running. Increase speed to medium and beat for 30 seconds. Repeat method 3 more times with each egg.</li>
	<li>If needed, scrape the sides of the bowl and mix for at medium-high speed for 30 more seconds.</li>
	<li>Pour batter into prepared pan and bake for around 27 minutes. Cake will be golden brown and just beginning to pull away from edges of pan when done. You can also test it by inserting a toothpick, which should come out clean.</li>

<h2>
	Assembling the Cake Pops
</h2>
<h3>
	Ingredients
</h3>
<ul>
	<li>20 ounces of white chocolate</li>
	<li>Canola oil (optional)</li>
	<li>6" lollipop sticks</li>
	<li>Pretzel rods, broken into thirds</li>
	<li>Black edible pen</li>
	<li>Chocolate covered sunflower seeds</li>
</ul>
<h3>
	Method
</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Once cake is completely cooled, cut into 6 pieces. Using your hands, crumble each piece into a large bowl (or you could use a food processor instead).</li>
	<li>Add frosting to bowl and mix with the back of a spoon or your clean, dry hands until thoroughly combined.</li>
	<li>Roll into 1 1/2-inch balls.</li>
	<li>Place cake balls on a baking sheet covered in wax paper and chill for several hours in the refrigerator or for 15 minutes in the freezer. (If you put them in the fridge, I recommend freezing them for 10 minutes while you melt the chocolate.)</li>
	<li>In a double boiler or in a microwave, melt the chocolate, stirring until all lumps are gone. Stir in a 1-2 tablespoons of oil to thin the chocolate if desired (the more you add, the thinner the coating will be).</li>
	<li>Once chocolate is melted, remove from heat and pour into a cup. Let cool for a few minutes.</li>
	<li>Remove cake balls from freezer. Working with 2 balls at a time, stack them. Dip one end of a lollipop into the melted chocolate, then stick it straight down into the stacked balls.</li>
	<li>Holding the lollipop stick, dip both cake balls into the melted chocolate until they’re completely covered and quickly remove.</li>
	<li>Hold pop over cup while excess chocolate drips off (if needed, tap your wrist with the opposite hand to help the process).</li>
	<li>Place onto wax paper. Push 2 pretzel pieces onto opposite sides of bottom ball and 1 orange chocolate covered sunflower seed onto the middle of the top ball.</li>
	<li>Once chocolate has hardened on all pops, use edible ink pen to draw eyes, mouth and buttons.</li>
	<li>Store covered in fridge until ready to serve.</li>
