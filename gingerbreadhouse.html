<h1>
	Gingerbread House
</h1>
<h3>
	Ingredients
</h3>
<ul>
	<li>4 tablespoons maple syrup</li>
	<li>2 tablespoons treacle</li>
	<li>160g muscovado sugar</li>
	<li>2 teaspoons ground ginger</li>
	<li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
	<li>200g unsalted butter, cut into cubes</li>
	<li>1 orange</li>
	<li>460g plain flour, plus extra</li>
	<li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
	<li>2 free range egg whites</li>
	<li>500g icing sugar</li>
	<li>sweets and edible glitter, to decorate</li>
</ul>
<h3>
	Methods
</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Put a small saucepan on a low heat, add the maple syrup, treacle, sugar, ginger and cinnamon with 4 tablespoons of water and combine with a wooden spoon. Keep stirring until the mixture boils.</li>
	<li>Carefully take the pan off the heat and add the butter, saving 1 piece. Let it all melt in, stirring to combine, then grate in the orange zest.</li>
	<li>Stir in the flour and baking powder until everything comes together as a dough. If it’s very sticky, dust it with flour, then wrap it in cling film and refrigerate for half an hour.</li>
	<li>Preheat your oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Dust your work surface and rolling pin with flour, then roll the dough out to about 5mm thick. Using a sharp knife, cut out pieces for your house.</li>
	<li>You’ll need six pieces, in three different shapes measuring: sides: 20cm x 14cm; roof: 21cm x 7cm; gable ends: 10cm (base) x 14cm (outer sides) x 18cm (apex). Any scraps can be pressed together and rolled out for the next pieces.</li>
	<li>Grease a baking tray with your reserved butter. Place your house pieces on the tray, leaving a 1cm gap between them. Bake in the oven for 12–15 minutes, or until golden and slightly darker around the edges.</li>
	<li>Let the gingerbread cool completely before icing. Whisk your egg whites to stiff peaks then, while whisking, gradually mix in the icing sugar till you have a dense stiff meringue. Use this to glue your gingerbread pieces together.</li>
	<li>Decorate with sweets, using more of the icing as glue, then very lightly dust with glitter for sparkly snow.</li>
